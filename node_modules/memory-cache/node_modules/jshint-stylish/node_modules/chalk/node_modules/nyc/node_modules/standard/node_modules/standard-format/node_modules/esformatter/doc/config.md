# Configuration

When running `esformatter` executable on the terminal, it will look for the
closest `.esformatter` file and use that as a setting unless you specify
`--preset default` or `--config ./path/to/config_file.json`.

You also have the option to put your `esformatter` settings inside the
`package.json` file under the `esformatter` property.

## property names

Most of the property names are based on the [esprima AST node
types](http://esprima.org/demo/parse.html). For a list of node types you can
also check the [estree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree).

Our [default settings](../lib/preset/default.json) should have all the names
that we recognize, even if we don't list them in all the places the config
probably use the same ids on all the settings (`indent`, `lineBreak` and
`whiteSpace`), don't get intimidated by the names!

## root

Settings from multiple files will be merged until it finds a config file that
contains the property `"root": true`; that makes it easy to define exceptions
to the project rules without needing to copy all the shared properties. - for
an example see test files inside the `"test/compare/rc"` folder.

```js
{
  "root": true
}
```

## indent

Indent is responsible for whitespace at the front of each line. `indent.value`
is used for each indentation. The default indents with two spaces. Setting
`indent.value` to `"\t"` will switch to indentation using tabs.

The other properties for indent toggle indentation for specific elements. These
all refer to regular JavaScript statements except for `TopLevelFunctionBlock`.
This is enabled by default, with no special behaviour. When disabled (set to
`0`), esformatter will not indent top level function blocks (used by the
jQuery preset).

 - negative integer (`-1` till `-99`): decrease indent level by `[n]`.
 - `0`: don't increase or decrease indent level.
 - positive integer (`1` till `99`): increase indent level by `[n]`.

```js
{
  "indent": {
    "value": "\t",
    "FunctionExpression": 1,
    "ArrayExpression": 0,
