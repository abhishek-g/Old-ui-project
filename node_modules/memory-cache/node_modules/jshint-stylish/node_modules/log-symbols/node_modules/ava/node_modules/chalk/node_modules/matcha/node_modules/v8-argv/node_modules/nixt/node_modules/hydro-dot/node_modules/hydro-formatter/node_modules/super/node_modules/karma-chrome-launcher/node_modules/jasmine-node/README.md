This node.js module makes the wonderful [Pivotal Lab's jasmine](http://github.com/pivotal/jasmine)
spec framework available in node.js.

jasmine
-------

Version `1.3.1` of Jasmine is currently included with node-jasmine. This is a forked version from the
[Karma project](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine), which allows you to use the
`ddescribe` and `iit` functions to run individual suites or specs.

BETA `2.0.0` Support is available in the `Jasmine2.0` branch.

install
------

To install the latest official version, use NPM:

```sh
npm install jasmine-node -g
```

To install the latest _bleeding edge_ version, clone this repository and check
out the `beta` branch.

usage
------

Write the specifications for your code in `*.js` and `*.coffee` files in the `spec/` directory.
You can use sub-directories to better organise your specs. In the specs use `describe()`, `it()` etc. exactly
as you would in client-side jasmine specs.

**Note**: your specification files must be named as `*spec.js`, `*spec.coffee` or `*spec.litcoffee`,
which matches the regular expression `/spec\.(js|coffee|litcoffee)$/i`;
otherwise jasmine-node won't find them!
For example, `sampleSpecs.js` is wrong, `sampleSpec.js` is right.

If you have installed the npm package, you can run it with:

```sh
jasmine-node spec/
```

If you aren't using npm, you should add `pwd`/lib to the `$NODE_PATH`
environment variable, then run:

```sh
node lib/jasmine-node/cli.js
```


You can supply the following arguments:

  * `--autotest`, provides automatic execution of specs after each change
  * `--watch`, when used with `--autotest`, paths after `--watch` will be
watched for changes, allowing to watch for changes outside of specs directory
  * `--coffee`, allow execution of `.coffee` and `.litcoffee` specs
  * `--color`, indicates spec output should uses color to
indicates passing (green) or failing (red) specs
  * `--noColor`, do not use color in the output
  * `-m, --match REGEXP`, match only specs containing "REGEXPspec"
  * `--matchall`, relax requirement of "spec" in spec file names
  * `--verbose`, verbose output as the specs are run
  * `--junitreport`, export tests results as junitreport xml format
  * `--output FOLDER`, defines the output folder for junitreport files
  * `--teamcity`, converts all console output to teamcity custom test runner commands. (Normally auto detected.)
  * `--growl`, display test run summary in a growl notification (in addition to other outputs)
  * `--runWithRe
