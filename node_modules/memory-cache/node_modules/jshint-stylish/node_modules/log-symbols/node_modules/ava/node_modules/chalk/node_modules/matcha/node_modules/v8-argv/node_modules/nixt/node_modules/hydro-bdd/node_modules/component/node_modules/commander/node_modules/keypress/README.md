keypress
========
### Make any Node ReadableStream emit "keypress" events


Previous to Node `v0.8.x`, there was an undocumented `"keypress"` event that
`process.stdin` would emit when it was a TTY. Some people discovered this hidden
gem, and started using it in their own code.

Now in Node `v0.8.x`, this `"keypress"` event does not get emitted by default,
but rather only when it is being used in conjuction with the `readline` (or by
extension, the `repl`) module.

This module is the exact logic from the node `v0.8.x` releases ripped out into its
own module.

__Bonus:__ Now with mouse support!

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install keypress
```

Or add it to the `"dependencies"` section of your _package.json_ file.


Example
-------

#### Listening for "keypress" events

``` js
var keypress = require('keypress');

// make `process.stdin` begin emitting "keypress" events
keypress(process.stdin);

// listen for the "keypress" event
process.stdin.on('keypress', function (ch, key) {
  console.log('got "keypress"', key);
  if (key && key.ctrl && key.name == 'c') {
    process.stdin.pause();
  }
});

process.stdin.setRawMode(true);
process.stdin.resume();
```

#### Listening for "mousepress" events

``` js
var keypress = require('keypress');

// make `process.stdin` begin emitting "mousepress" (and "keypress") events
keypress(process.stdin);

// you must enable the mouse events before they will begin firing
keypress.enableMouse(process.stdout);

process.stdin.on('mousepress', function (info) {
  console.log('got "mousepress" event at %d x %d', info.x, info.y);
});

process.on('exit', function () {
  // disable mouse on exit, so that the state
  // is back to normal for the terminal
  keypress.disableMouse(process.stdout);
});
```
