	 * Periodically execute the work function on the msec delay. The result of
	 * the work may be verified by watching for a condition to become true. The
	 * returned deferred is cancellable if the polling needs to be cancelled
	 * externally before reaching a resolved state.
	 *
	 * The next vote is scheduled after the results of the current vote are
	 * verified and rejected.
	 *
	 * Polling may be terminated by the verifier returning a truthy value,
	 * invoking cancel() on the returned promise, or the work function returning
	 * a rejected promise.
	 *
	 * Usage:
	 *
	 * var count = 0;
	 * function doSomething() { return count++ }
	 *
