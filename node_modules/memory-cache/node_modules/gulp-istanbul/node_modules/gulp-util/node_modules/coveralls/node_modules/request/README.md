# Request — Simplified HTTP client

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/request.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/request/)

## Super simple to use

Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.

```javascript
var request = require('request');
request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
    console.log(body) // Print the google web page.
  }
})
```

## Streaming

You can stream any response to a file stream.

```javascript
request('http://google.com/doodle.png').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('doodle.png'))
```

You can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types (in this case `application/json`) and use the proper `content-type` in the PUT request (if the headers don’t already provide one).

```javascript
fs.createReadStream('file.json').pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/obj.json'))
```

Request can also `pipe` to itself. When doing so, `content-type` and `content-length` are preserved in the PUT headers.

```javascript
request.get('http://google.com/img.png').pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/img.png'))
```

Now let’s get fancy.

```javascript
http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    if (req.method === 'PUT') {
      req.pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/doodle.png'))
    } else if (req.method === 'GET' || req.method === 'HEAD') {
      request.get('http://mysite.com/doodle.png').pipe(resp)
    }
  }
})
```

You can also `pipe()` from `http.ServerRequest` instances, as well as to `http.ServerResponse` instances. The HTTP method, headers, and entity-body data will be sent. Which means that, if you don't really care about security, you can do:

```javascript
http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    var x = request('http://mysite.com/doodle.png')
    req.pipe(x)
    x.pipe(resp)
  }
})
```

And since `pipe()` returns the destination stream in ≥ Node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying. :)

```javascript
req.pipe(request('http://mysite.com/doodle.png')).pipe(resp)
```

Also, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.

```javascript
var r = request.defaults({'proxy':'http://localproxy.com'})

http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    r.get('http://google.com/doodle.png').pipe(resp)
  }
})
```

You can still use i
