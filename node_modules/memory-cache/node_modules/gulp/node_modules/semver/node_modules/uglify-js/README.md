UglifyJS 2
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)

UglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.

This page documents the command line utility.  For
[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).
There's also an
[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,
Chrome and probably Safari).

Install
-------

First make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
(You may need to restart your computer after this step).

From NPM for use as a command line app:

    npm install uglify-js -g

From NPM for programmatic use:

    npm install uglify-js

From Git:

    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git
    cd UglifyJS2
    npm link .

Usage
-----

    uglifyjs [input files] [options]

UglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the
input files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files
in sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the
same global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some
variable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.

If you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input
files.

The available options are:

    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.
                                                                          [string]
    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the
                       source map.                                        [string]
    --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //@
                       sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with
                       --source-map.                                      [string]
    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was
                       generated from some other original code.
    --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance with
                       Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS will try
                       to be IE-proof).
    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source
                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file
                       names and ensure they are relative paths.
    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).
    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]
    -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]
    -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.
    -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options
                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no
                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]
    -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]
    --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this
                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments
                       that contain "@license" or "@preserve". You can optionally
                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:
                       - "all" to keep all comments
                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep
                       only comments that match.
                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when
                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or
                       cascading statements into sequences.               [string]
    --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]
    --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]
    --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).
                                                                         [boolean]
    --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies
                       --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]
    --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”
                       and “global” variables available. You need to pass an
                       argument to this option to specify the name that your
                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.
                                                                          [string]
    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to
                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]
    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]
    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]
    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]

Specify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output
goes to STDOUT.

## Source map options

UglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for
debugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass
`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the
source map dumped).

Additionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the
original files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input
files to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of
directories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source
map.

For example:

    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \
             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \
             -o foo.min.js \
             --source-map foo.min.js.map \
             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \
             -p 5 -c -m

The above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the
output in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source
mapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and
`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`
as the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and
`js/file2.js`).

### Composed source map

When you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as
CoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd
like to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an
option to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from
CoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →
compressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original
location.

To use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map
/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point
to the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit
input files from the command line.

## Mangler options

To enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following
(comma-separated) options are supported:

- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This
  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is
  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it
  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.

- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by
  default).

- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or
