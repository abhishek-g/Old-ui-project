/**
 * a mechanism to merge multiple coverage objects into one. Handles the use case
 * of overlapping coverage information for the same files in multiple coverage
 * objects and does not double-count in this situation. For example, if
 * you pass the same coverage object multiple times, the final merged object will be
 * no different that any of the objects passed in (except for execution counts).
 *
 * The `Collector` is built for scale to handle thousands of coverage objects.
 * By default, all processing is done in memory since the common use-case is of
 * one or a few coverage objects. You can work around memory
 * issues by passing in a `Store` implementation that stores temporary computations
 * on disk (the `tmp` store, for example).
 *
 * The `getFinalCoverage` method returns an object with merged coverage information
 * and is provided as a convenience for implementors working with coverage information
 * that can fit into memory. Reporters, in the interest of generality, should *not* use this method for
 * creating reports.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *
 *      var collector = new require('istanbul').Collector();
 *
 *      files.forEach(function (f) {
 *          //each coverage object can have overlapping information about multiple files
 *          collector.add(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(f, 'utf8')));
 *      });
 *
 *      collector.files().forEach(function(file) {
 *          var fileCoverage = collector.fileCoverageFor(file);
 *          console.log('Coverage for ' + file + ' is:' + JSON.stringify(fileCoverage));
 *      });
 *
 *      // convenience method: do not use this when dealing with a large number of files
 *      var finalCoverage = collector.getFinalCoverage();
 *
 * @class Collector
 * @module main
 * @constructor
 * @param {Object} options Optional. Configuration options.
 * @param {Store} options.store - an implementation of `Store` to use for temporary
 *      calculations.
