## Getting Started

Install it in your browser:

```html
<script src="uuid.js"></script>
```

Or in node.js:

```
npm install node-uuid
```

```javascript
var uuid = require('node-uuid');
```

Then create some ids ...

```javascript
// Generate a v1 (time-based) id
uuid.v1(); // -> '6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a'

//
