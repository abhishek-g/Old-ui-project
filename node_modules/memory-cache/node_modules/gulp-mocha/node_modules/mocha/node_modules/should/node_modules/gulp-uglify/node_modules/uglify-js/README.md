UglifyJS 2
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)

UglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.

This page documents the command line utility.  For
[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).
There's also an
[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,
Chrome and probably Safari).

Install
-------

First make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
(You may need to restart your computer after this step).

From NPM for use as a command line app:

    npm install uglify-js -g

From NPM for programmatic use:

    npm install uglify-js

From Git:

    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git
    cd UglifyJS2
    npm link .

Usage
-----

    uglifyjs [input files] [options]

UglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the
input files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files
in sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the
same global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some
variable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.

If you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input
files.

The available options are:

```
  --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.
                                                                        [string]
  --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the
                     source map.                                        [string]
  --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //#
                     sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with
                     --source-map.                                      [string]
  --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was
                     generated from some other original code.
  --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance
                     with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS
                     will try to be IE-proof).                         [boolean]
  --expr             Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for
                     parsing JSON)                                     [boolean]
  -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source
                     maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file
                     names and ensure they are relative paths. You can also
                     specify -p relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out
                     itself the relative paths between original sources, the
                     source map and the output file.                    [string]
  -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).
  -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]
  -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]
  -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.
  -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options
                     like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no
                     argument to use the default compression options.   [string]
  -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]
  -e, --enclose      Embed everything in a big function, with a configurable
                     parameter/argument list.                           [string]
  --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this
                     works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments
                     that contain "@license" or "@preserve". You can optionally
                     pass one of the following arguments to this flag:
                     - "all" to keep all comments
                     - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep
                     only comments that match.
                     Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when
                     compression is on, because of dead code removal or
                     cascading statements into sequences.               [string]
  --preamble         Preamble to prepend to the output.  You can use this to
                     insert a comment, for example for licensing information.
                     This will not be parsed, but the source map will adjust
                     for its presence.
  --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]
  --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]
  --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).
                                                                       [boolean]
  --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies
                     --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]
  --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”
                     and “global” variables available. You need to pass an
                     argument to this option to specify the name that your
                     module will take when included in, say, a browser.
                                                                        [string]
  --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to
                     automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]
  --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]
  -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]
  -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]
```

Specify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output
goes to STDOUT.

## Source map options

UglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for
debugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass
`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the
source map dumped).

Additionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the
original files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input
files to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of
directories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source
map.

For example:

    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \
             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \
             -o foo.min.js \
             --source-map foo.min.js.map \
             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \
             -p 5 -c -m

The above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the
output in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source
mapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and
`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`
as the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and
`js/file2.js`).

### Composed source map

When you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as
CoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd
like to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an
option to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from
CoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →
compressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original
location.

To use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map
/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point
to the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit
input files from the command line.

## Mangler options

To enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following
(comma-separated) options are supported:

- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This
  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is
  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it
  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.

- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by
  default).

- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used
  (disabled by default).

When mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being
mangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a
comma-separated list of names.  For example:

    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'

to prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.

## Compressor options

You need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally
you can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form
`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want
to set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).

- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator

- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for
  example `foo["bar"] → foo.bar`

- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code

- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements

- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply "unsafe" transformations (discussion below)

- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional
  expressions

- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:
  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,
  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.

- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions

- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a
  ? b : c → a ? b : c`

- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can
  statically determine the condition

- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables

- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations

- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`
  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)

- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue

- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements

- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`
  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`

- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused
  declarations etc.

- `negate_iife` -- negate "Immediately-Called Function Expressions"
  where the return value is discarded, to avoid the parens that the
  code generator would insert.

- `pure_getters` -- the default is `false`.  If you pass `true` for
  this, UglifyJS will assume that object property access
  (e.g. `foo.bar` or `foo["bar"]`) doesn't have any side effects.

- `pure_funcs` -- default `null`.  You can pass an array of names and
  UglifyJS will assume that those functions do not produce side
  effects.  DANGER: will not check if the name is redefined in scope.
  An example case here, for instance `var q = Math.floor(a/b)`.  If
  variable `q` is not used elsewhere, UglifyJS will drop it, but will
  still keep the `Math.floor(a/b)`, not knowing what it does.  You can
  pass `pure_funcs: [ 'Math.floor' ]` to let it know that this
  function won't produce any side effect, in which case the whole
  statement would get discarded.  The current implementation adds some
  overhead (compression will be slower).

### The `unsafe` option

It enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain
contrived cases, but sho
