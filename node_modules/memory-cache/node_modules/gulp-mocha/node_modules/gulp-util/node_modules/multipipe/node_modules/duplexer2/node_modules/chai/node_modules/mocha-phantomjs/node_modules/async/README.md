# Async.js

Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions
for working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for
use with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the
browser.

Async provides around 20 functions that include the usual 'functional'
suspects (map, reduce, filter, forEach…) as well as some common patterns
for asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…). All these
functions assume you follow the node.js convention of providing a single
callback as the last argument of your async function.


## Quick Examples

    async.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results){
        // results is now an array of stats for each file
    });

    async.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], path.exists, function(results){
        // results now equals an array of the existing files
    });

    async.parallel([
        function(){ ... },
        function(){ ... }
    ], callback);

    async.series([
        function(){ ... },
        function(){ ... }
    ]);

There are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a
full list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is
missing please create a GitHub issue for it.


## Download

Releases are available for download from
[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async/downloads).
Alternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (npm):

    npm install async

## In the Browser

So far its been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. Usage:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">

        async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){
            alert(results);
        });

    </script>

## Collections

<a name="forEach" />
### forEach(arr, iterator, callback)

Applies an iterator function to each item in an array, in parallel.
The iterator is called with an item from the list and a callback for when it
has finished. If the iterator passes an error to this callback, the main
callback for the forEach function is immediately called with the error.

Note, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel
there is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.
* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions
  have finished, or an error has occurred.

__Example__

    // assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function
    // to save the modified contents of that file:

    async.forEach(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){
        // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error
    });

<a name="forEachSeries" />
### forEachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)

The same as forEach only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in
series. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed
processing. This means the iterator functions will complete in order.
