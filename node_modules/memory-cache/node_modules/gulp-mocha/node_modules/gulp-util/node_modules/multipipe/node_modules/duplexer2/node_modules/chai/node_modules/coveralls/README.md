[Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) support for node.js.  Get the great coverage reporting of coveralls.io and add a cool coverage button ( like the one above ) to your README.

##Installation: 
Add the latest version of `coveralls` to your package.json:
``` 
npm install coveralls --save 
```

If you're using mocha, add `mocha-lcov-reporter` to your package.json:
``` 
npm install mocha-lcov-reporter --save 
```

##Usage:

This script ( `bin/coveralls.js` ) can take standard input from any tool that emits the lcov data format (including [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/)'s [LCov reporter](https://npmjs.org/package/mocha-lcov-reporter)) and send it to coveralls.io to report your code coverage there.
