# Introduction

**Hawk** is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with
partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host,
and optionally the request payload.

Similar to the HTTP [Digest access authentication schemes](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt), **Hawk** uses a set of
client credentials which include an identifier (e.g. username) and key (e.g. password). Likewise, just as with the Digest scheme,
the key is never included in authenticated requests. Instead, it is used to calculate a request MAC value which is
included in its place.

However, **Hawk** has several differences from Digest. In particular, while both use a nonce to limit the possibility of
replay attacks, in **Hawk** the client generates the nonce and uses it in combination with a timestamp, leading to less
"chattiness" (interaction with the server).

Also unlike Digest, this scheme is not intended to protect the key itself (the password in Digest) because
the client and server must both have access to the key material in the clear.

The primary design goals of this scheme are to:
* simplify and improve HTTP authentication for services that are unwilling or unable to deploy TLS for all resources,
* secure credentials against leakage (e.g., when the client uses some form of dynamic configuration to determine where
  to send an authenticated request), and
* avoid the exposure of credentials sent to a malicious server over an unauthenticated secure channel due to client
  failure to validate the server's identity as part of its TLS handshake.

In addition, **Hawk** supports a method for granting third-parties temporary access to individual resources using
a query parameter called _bewit_ (in falconry, a leather strap used to attach a tracking device to the leg of a hawk).

The **Hawk** scheme requires the establishment of a shared symmetric key between the client and the server,
which is beyond the scope of this module. Typically, the shared credentials are established via an initial
TLS-protected phase or derived from some other shared confidential information available to both the client
and the server.


## Replay Protection

Without replay protection, an attacker can use a compromised (but otherwise valid and authenticated) request more 
than once, gaining access to a protected resource. To mitigate this, clients include both a nonce and a timestamp when 
making requests. This gives the server enough information to prevent replay attacks.

The nonce is generated by the client, and is a string unique across all requests with the same timestamp and
key identifier combination. 

The timestamp enables the server to restrict the validity period of the credentials where requests occuring afterwards
are rejected. It also removes the need for the server to retain an unbounded number of nonce values for future checks.
By default, **Hawk** uses a time window of 1 minute to allow for time skew between the client and server (which in
practice translates to a maximum of 2 minutes as the skew can be positive or negative).

Using a timestamp requires the client's clock to be in sync with the server's clock. **Hawk** requires both the client
clock and the server clock to use NTP to ensure synchronization. However, given the limitations of some client types
(e.g. browsers) to deploy NTP, the server provides the client with its current time (in seconds precision) in response
to a bad timestamp.

There is no expectation that the client will adjust its system clock to match the server (in fact, this would be a
potential attack vector). Instead, the client only uses the server's time to calculate an offset used only
for communications with that particular server. The protocol rewards clients with synchronized clocks by reducing
the number of round trips required to authenticate the first request.


## Usage Example

Server code:

```javascript
var Http = require('http');
var Hawk = require('hawk');


// Credentials lookup function

var credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {

    var credentials = {
        key: 'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn',
        algorithm: 'sha256',
        user: 'Steve'
    };

    return callback(null, credentials);
};

// Create HTTP server

var handler = function (req, res) {

    // Authenticate incoming request

    Hawk.server.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, artifacts) {

        // Prepare response

        var payload = (!err ? 'Hello ' + credentials.user + ' ' + artifacts.ext : 'Shoosh!');
        var headers = { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' };

        // Generate Server-Authorization response header

        var header = Hawk.server.header(credentials, artifacts, { payload: payload, contentType: headers['Content-Type'] });
        headers['Server-Authorization'] = header;

        // Send the response back

        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, headers);
        res.end(payload);
    });
};

// Start server

Http.createServer(handler).listen(8000, 'example.com');
```

Client code:

```javascript
var Request = require('request');
var Hawk = require('hawk');


// Client credentials

var credentials = {
    id: 'dh37fgj492je',
    key: 'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn',
    algorithm: 'sha256'
}

// Request options

var requestOptions = {
    uri: 'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {}
};

// Generate Authorization request header

var header = Hawk.client.header('http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2', 'GET', { credentials: credentials, ext: 'some-app-data' });
requestOptions.headers.Authorization = header.field;

// Send authenticated request

Request(requestOptions, function (error, response, body) {

    // Authenticate the server's response

    var isValid = Hawk.client.authenticate(response, credentials, header.artifacts, { payload: body });

    // Output results

    console.log(response.statusCode + ': ' + body + (isValid ? ' (valid)' : ' (invalid)'));
});
```

**Hawk** utilized the [**SNTP**](https://github.com/hueniverse/sntp) module for time sync management. By default, the local
machine time is used. To automatically retrieve and synchronice the clock within the application, use the SNTP 'start()' method.

```javascript
Hawk.sntp.start();
```


## Protocol Example

The client attempts to access a protected resource without authentication, sending the following HTTP request to
the resource server:

```
GET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com:8000
```

The resource server returns an authentication challenge.

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Hawk
```

The client has previously obtained a set of **Hawk** credentials for accessing resources on the "http://example.com/"
server. The **Hawk** credentials issued to the client include the following attributes:

* Key identifier: dh37fgj492je
* Key: werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn
* Algorithm: sha256

The client generates the authentication header by calculating a timestamp (e.g. the number of seconds since January 1,
1970 00:00:00 GMT), generating a nonce, and constructing the normalized request string (each value followed by a newline
character):

```
hawk.1.header
1353832234
j4h3g2
GET
/resource/1?b=1&a=2
example.com
8000

some-app-ext-data

```

The request MAC is calculated using HMAC with the specified hash algorithm "sha256" and the key over the normalized request string.
The result is base64-encoded to produce the request MAC:

```
6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE=
```

The client includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, application specific data, and request MAC with the request using
the HTTP `Authorization` request header field:

```
GET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com:8000
Authorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE="
```

The server validates the request by calculating the request MAC again based on the request received and verifies the validity
and scope of the **Hawk** credentials. If valid, the server responds with the requested resource.


### Payload Validation

**Hawk** provides optional payload validation. When generating the authentication header, the client calculates a payload hash
using the specified hash algorithm. The hash is calculated over the concatenated value of (each followed by a newline character):
* `hawk.1.payload`
* the content-type in lowercase, without any parameters (e.g. `application/json`)
* the request payload prior to any content encoding (the exact representation requirements should be specified by the server for payloads other than simple single-part ascii to ensure interoperability)

For example:

* Payload: `Thank you for flying Hawk`
* Content Type: `text/plain`
* Hash (sha256): `Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=`

Results in the following input to the payload hash function (newline terminated values):

```
hawk.1.payload
text/plain
Thank you for flying Hawk

```

Which produces the following hash value:

```
Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=
```

The client constructs the normalized request string (newline terminated values):

```
hawk.1.header
1353832234
j4h3g2
POST
/resource/1?a=1&b=2
example.com
8000
Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=
some-app-ext-data

```

Then calculates the request MAC and includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, payload hash, application specific data,
and request MAC, with the request using the HTTP `Authorization` request header field:

```
POST /resource/1?a=1&b=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com:8000
Authorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", hash="Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="aSe1DERmZuRl3pI36/9BdZmnErTw3sNzOOAUlfeKjVw="
```

It is up to the server if and when it validates the payload for any given request, based solely on it's security policy
and the nature of the data included.

If the payload is available at the time of authentication, the server uses the hash value provided by the client to construct
the normalized string and validates the MAC. If the MAC is valid, the server calculates the payload hash and compares the value
with the provided payload hash in the header. In many cases, checking the MAC first is faster than calculating the payload hash.

However, if the payload is not available at authentication time (e.g. too large to fit in memory, streamed elsewhere, or processed
at a different stage in the application), the server may choose to defer payload validation for later by retaining the hash value
provided by the client after validating the MAC.

It is important to note that MAC validation does not mean the hash value provided by the client is valid, only that the value
included in the header was not modified. Without calculating the payload hash on the server and comparing it to the value provided
by the client, the payload may be modified by an attacker.


## Response Payload Validation

**Hawk** provides partial response payload validation. The server includes the `Server-Authorization` response header which enables the
client to authenticate the response and ensure it is talking to the right server. **Hawk** defines the HTTP `Server-Authorization` header
as a response header using the exact same syntax as the `Authorization` request header field.

The header is contructed using the same process as the client's request header. The server uses the same credentials and other
artifacts provided by the client to constructs the normalized request string. The `ext` and `hash` values are replaced with
new values based on the server response. The rest as identical to those used by the client.

The result MAC digest is included with the optional `hash` and `ext` values:

```
Server-Authorization: Hawk mac="XIJRsMl/4oL+nn+vKoeVZPdCHXB4yJkNnBbTbHFZUYE=", hash="f9cDF/TDm7TkYRLnGwRMfeDzT6LixQVLvrIKhh0vgmM=", ext="response-specific"
```


## Browser Support and Considerations

A browser script is provided for including using a `<script>` tag in [lib/browser.js](/lib/browser.js).

**Hawk** relies on the _Server-Authorization_ and _WWW-Authenticate_ headers in its response to communicate with the client.
Therefore, in case of CORS requests, it is important to consider sending _Access-Control-Expose-Headers_ with the value
_"WWW-Authenticate, Server-Authorization"_ on each response from your server. As explained in the
[specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-expose-headers-response-header), it will indicate that these headers
can safely be accessed by the client (using getResponseHeader() on the XmlHttpRequest object). Otherwise you will be met with a
["simple response header"](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-response-header) which excludes these fields and would prevent the
Hawk client from authenticating the requests.You can read more about the why and how in this
[article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-adding-cors-support-to-the-server)


# Single URI Authorization

There are cases in which limited and short-term access to a protected resource is granted to a third party which does not
have access to the shared credentials. For example, displaying a protected image on a web page accessed by anyone. **Hawk**
provides limited support for such URIs in the form of a _bewit_ - a URI query parameter appended to the request URI which contains
the necessary credentials to authenticate the request.

Because of the significant security risks involved in issuing such access, bewit usage is purposely limited only to GET requests
and for a finite period of time. Both the client and server can issue bewit credentials, however, the server should not use the same
credentials as the client to maintain clear traceability as to who issued which credentials.

In order to simplify implementation, bewit credentials do not support single-use policy and can be replayed multiple times within
the granted access timeframe. 


## Bewit Usage Example

Server code:

```javascript
var Http = require('http');
var Hawk = require('hawk');


// Credentials lookup function

var credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {

    var credentials = {
        key: 'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn',
        algorithm: 'sha256'
    };

    return callback(null, credentials);
};

// Create HTTP server

var handler = function (req, res) {

    Hawk.uri.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, attributes) {

        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
        res.end(!err ? 'Access granted' : 'Shoosh!');
    });
};

Http.createServer(handler).listen(8000, 'example.com');
```

Bewit code generation:

```javascript
var Request = require('request');
var Hawk = require('hawk');


// Client credentials

var credentials = {
    id: 'dh37fgj492je',
    key: 'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn',
    algorithm: 'sha256'
}

// Generate bewit

var duration = 60 * 5;      // 5 Minutes
var bewit = Hawk.uri.getBewit('http://example.com:8080/resource/1?b=1&a=2', { credentials: credentials, ttlSec: duration, ext: 'some-app-data' });
var uri = 'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2' + '&bewit=' + bewit;
```


# Security Considerations

The greatest sources of security risks are usually found not in **Hawk** but in the policies and procedures surrounding its use.
Implementers are strongly encouraged to assess how this module addresses their security requirements. This section includes
an incomplete list of security considerations that must be reviewed and understood before deploying **Hawk** on the server.
Many of the protections provided in **Hawk** depends on whether and how they are used.

### MAC Keys Transmission

**Hawk** does not provide any mechanism for obtaining or transmitting the set of shared credentials required. Any mechanism used
to obtain **Hawk** credentials must ensure that these transmissions are protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS.

### Confidentiality of Requests

While **Hawk** provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of HTTP requests, it provides no guarantee of request
confidentiality. Unless other precautions are taken, eavesdroppers will have full access to the request content. Servers should
carefully consider the types of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and employ transport-layer security mechanisms
to protect sensitive resources.

### Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers

**Hawk** provides limited verification of the server authenticity. When receiving a response back from the server, the server
may choose to include a response `Server-Authorization` header which the client can use to verify the response. However, it is up to
the server to determine when such measure is included, to up to the client to enforce that policy.

A hostile party could take advantage of this by intercepting the client's requests and returning misleading or otherwise
incorrect responses. Service providers should consider such attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should
require transport-layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the resource server or of server responses is an issue.

### Plaintext Storage of Credentials

The **Hawk** key functions the same way passwords do in traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the request MAC,
the server must have access to the key in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems, which
store only a one-way hash of user credentials.

If an attacker were to gain access to these keys - or worse, to the server's database of all such keys - he or she would be able
to perform any action on behalf of any resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these keys from unauthorized
access.

### Entropy of Keys

Unless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access to authenticated requests and request
MAC values, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force attacks to recover the key used. Servers should be careful to
assign keys which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at least the length of time that the **Hawk**
credentials are valid.

For example, if the credentials are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is not possible to mount a brute force
attack that recovers the key in less than two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the
longest key reasonable.

It is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate these keys be of sufficiently high
quality. Many PRNG implementations generate number sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit
patterns or other weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be careful to use
cryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.

### Coverage Limitations

The request MAC only covers the HTTP `Host` header and optionally the `Content-Type` header. It does not cover any other headers
which can often affect how the request body is interpreted by the server. If the server behavior is influenced by the presence
or value of such headers, an attacker can manipulate the request headers without being detected. Implementers should use the
`ext` feature to pass application-specific information via the `Authorization` header which is protected by the request MAC.

The response authentication, when performed, only covers the resp
